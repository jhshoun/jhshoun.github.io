<u>VP Software Development</u>
<br/>
My largest title, but also the smallest company I've been with. It was a 
startup before there was VC.
A great learning experience developing a complex application during the early 
days of the PC. In addition to honing development skills I did learn my limits; while
a good developer-engineer (strength) -- I was salesman unable to close the deal (weakness).
