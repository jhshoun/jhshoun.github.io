<u>Electrical Engineer</u>
<br/>
One of those corporate experiences where you are hired for one
job, but then put in another assignment.
I found that interesting work and learning experiences
are available in places that you might not expect -- 
just look for the possibilities.
Besides, I got to play with a lot of very large toys.

	<li>energy conservation programs & budgeting
	<li>project management
</ul>
